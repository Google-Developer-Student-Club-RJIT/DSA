# question descripton : You are given a string S, the task is to reverse the string using stack.

Example 1:

Input: S="GeeksforGeeks"
Output: skeeGrofskeeG

# logic: 
the logic is simple we have to just push the character into stack one by one and the we can replace the character of strings by the top of the stack(when stack is filled by all charachters of string) and then remove that element after replacing.
